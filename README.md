# histogram_spesification
Here we want to convert the image so that it has a particular histogram that can be arbitrarily specified. Such a mapping function can be found in three steps:

#1. Equalize the histogram of the input image
#2. Equalize the specified histogram
#3. Relate the two equalized histograms
